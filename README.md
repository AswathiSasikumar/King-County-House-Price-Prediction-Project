**Authors**:<font color='Blue'> Aswathi Sasikumar </font>

## Overview

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset which has data about houses in King county like price,condition,grade,no of bedrooms,floors etc.This projects helps stakeholder,Real-estate agency to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.The regression model developed in the project predicts the price of the house and how certain parameters affect the price of the house.

## Business Problem

Real-estate agency needs to provide advice to homeowners on what factors can increase the estimated value of their homes.The regression model developed in the project predicts the price of the house and identifies the parameters that can affect the price of the house.

## Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset.It has 21597 data records

## Methods

Exploratory data analysis was used to analyse the data and to draw conclusions and multiple regression was used to develop a model for predicting the price.


## Results

The Findings of the analysis are detailed below:


## Conclusions

Square footage, no of bedrooms and bathrooms are the best predictors of a house's price in King County. Homeowners who are interested in selling their homes at a higher price should focus on expanding square footage and improving the quality of construction.
